# Unblocked Torrent Sites and Torrent Proxy List 2023

Downloading torrents is one of the main activities of the internet. This allows files to be shared over the Internet using P2P protocols. Although torrents are considered legal, they are mainly used for sharing copyrighted content. As a result of the popularity of torrenting, hundreds of torrent websites have popped up over the course of a decade. As a result, copyright infringement has increased and torrents blocked.

The competent authorities of the countries are working to block such websites and penalize the users who access them. Proponents of DMCA and the fight against piracy have worked with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to crack down on users who download copyrighted material such as movies and music.

However, you can still easily bypass torrent blocking without the ISP and DMCA knowing about it.

Here are the 4 best ways to bypass torrent blocking.

# Use the HTTP proxy
The first option to avoid blocking torrents is the HTTP proxy.

Similar to a VPN, a proxy server can hide your IP address and connect you to a site that is being blocked. When you use a proxy, your traffic is sent through an intermediate server, which then forwards you to the blocked content. However, there are some issues with this method.

There are several proxy websites that you can tunnel and bypass torrent blocking.

# Use the TOR network
TOR is a special network that routes internet traffic by rerouting it through various servers before it reaches its destination. Makes tracking user activity very difficult. You can use the TOR network to bypass torrent blocking very easily.

You can download the Tor browser package for Windows, Mac Linux, or Android from Torproject.org.


# Change DNS server
This method is only effective if the reason you cannot access torrent websites is because of DNS blocking. Plus, it only unblocks torrent sites and doesn't hide your traffic. So it's useless if you want to securely download copyrighted material. Google's public DNS is a great option if you want to change your DNS server.

To change your DNS server settings in Windows 10 to Google Public DNS, do the following:

Go to **Network and Internet** and click **Change adapter settings**

Right click on the connection you want to configure and select **Properties**

On the **Networks tab**, select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)** and go to **Properties**.

Click **Use the following DNS server addresses** and enter **8.8.8.8** or **8.8.4.4**

If you're using macOS, you'll want to use the same DNS server addresses on the DNS tab in the **Apple menu> System Preferences> Network**.




# Use the VPN service
Virtual Private Service (VPN) is the easiest way to bypass torrent blocking. With a VPN, you can mask the spoofing of your real-world location and easily access restricted websites. It uses a network of private servers in different geographic locations and private IP addresses to spoof your location.

Since the Internet traffic then flows through the servers of the VPN service, the ISP cannot track the online activities of a user. Geo-spoofing allows users to access content that would otherwise be blocked in their country, such as: B. unblocking torrent websites. In addition, VPN services use advanced encryption technology that provides an additional layer of security. Internet traffic is not prone to infiltration.

DNS Blocking - If you try to go to the URL of a torrent site, your ISP's DNS server will direct you to the wrong IP address or ignore the request.
IP Blocking - IP addresses obtained from certain geographic locations can be blocked from accessing certain websites by an ISP.
Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): ISPs use DPI to analyze data packets from their network. This allows you to see the websites you want to access and block them from being used.
Firewall - Your ISP can use a firewall to block all connections to and from torrent sites. This is often the method used to block torrents in college.
Blocking / Throttling BitTorrent Ports: Traditionally, BitTorrent uses TCP ports 6881 to 6889 for file transfers. As such, it is not uncommon for ISPs to throttle or block these ports. Fortunately, this can be quickly bypassed by simply changing the port used by your torrent client.
